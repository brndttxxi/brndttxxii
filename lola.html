<p><font face= "Trebuchet MS" size="+1"> <blockquote> Meet my cutie lola! She's one of those people who will love you unconditionally. 
I can't express how grateful I am for her existence and selfless love. She's always there to support and stand by your side no matter the circumstance is. She'll always guide you to the right path and I value her opinions more than my own. She's very wise and I follow her advice often. 
<br/> <br/> Whenever I have free time or during the weekends, I visit her in laguna just to spend time with her because I love her company so much and she feels like home to me. She also loves to watch K-Drama and her favorite actor is Park Bogum (somehow I influenced her to watch it)
and now she begs me download every movie of Park Bogum because she just can't get enough of his charm. <br/> <br/> 
I can't wait to graduate and find a job so that I can treat her to every place she deserves. This thought inspires me to do well in my studies. If I'm having a hard time, I would think of her and the comforting life I want her to experience and that's what drives me to enhance myself professionally. </p>
