<p> <blockquote> <font face="Trebuchet MS"> This is my first ever squad in highschool. We got the name faustinatics from our section name "St. Faustina" so we improvised and made it our squad name as "Faustinatics" XD
<br/> <br/> These people are one of those I can truly trust because we've grown together since our elementary days. They are literally my childhood besties. Although we don't meet often due to our busy and conflicting schedules, we're always there for each other.
And we ensure that after our stressful semesters, we occasionally meet to catch up.
<br/> <br/> To be honest, I rarely open up to other people and I choose my friends wisely. And these people proved that I can be myself whenever I'm with them and they accept me for who I am. I miss them so much and I thank them for making my highschool days colorful. <br/>  </p>
