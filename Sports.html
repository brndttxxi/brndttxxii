<br/> <br/> <blockquote> We ocassionally go to the gym when we have free time because it's a good way to unwind and relieve stress from school works.
And of course, it's a way of keeping our bodies fit and healthy. I enjoy going to the gym despite feeling sore after. I don't know why, I just enjoy it.
Maybe because I like to keep an active lifestyle.</blockquote>
