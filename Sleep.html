<p> <font face="Trebuchet MS"> <blockquote> The center photo was during a seminar about history in Tanghalang Julian Felipe. Notice that I wasn't the only one sleeping in the audience but my classmates as well. Because the discussion was
done in an early morning and the speakers were not that interesting so I chose to sleep despite the overwhelming guilt. And before I knew it, my classmate snapped a photo of me sleeping and teased me for it.
<br/> <br/>The other photos were during a cottillion practice for my friend's debut. We were in her house at that time and we chose to watch a horror movie "Seklusyon" and I barely noticed that I slept through
halfway during the movie. So when I woke up, I was wondering why the television was turned off then I realized that I coudln't stop myself from taking a nap. And of course, my friends made fun of me for stealing a nap XD </p>
<strong> <em> I suppose napping has become one of my favorite hobbies in life :D </em> </strong>
