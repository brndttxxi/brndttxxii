<p> <blockquote> <font face="Trebuchet MS"> We've been together since 1st year and I can't express how grateful I am that they became one of those important people in my life. I trust and cherish them alot because they 
made me realize that life is so much more. It sounds cliche but these people are my true friends and through tough situations they've proved how much they care for you and that they'll
never leave your side. <br/> <br/> Despite our demanding course and its retention policy, we've conquered every semester together and we plan to keep it that way until we graduate. Through hellish terms and the never ending requirements, we proved how well we can adapt and support each other. 
<br/> <br/> Soon, we'll have our own succesful lives and we might not see each other that often anymore but the memories that we made together will never be forgotten. I love these people so much!! <br/>  </p>
