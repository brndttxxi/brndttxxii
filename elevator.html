I'm not sure if I'm clautrophobic or just overdramatic but one thing's for sure is my immense fear for confined spaces. <br/> <br/>
You would never see me ride an elevator even if I have to go to the 38th floor inside a building. No. Never. I would seriously take the stairs no matter how long and tiring it would take as long as I don't ride the elevator and feel constricted.
Not just inside the elevator that I would feel anxious, other places including under ground tunnels as well. That's why I try to avoid taking the MRT and would gladly choose another transportation vehicle anytime. <br/> <br/>
I don't know why I have this constant fear of being trapped inside a confined place, maybe because I'm over thinking about worst case scenarios wherein I would be trapped but in reality I'm aware that it won't happen.</br> </br> 
Bottom line is, I just don't want to feel trapped.
